GenGUI: A Dataset for Automatic Web User Interface Generation

GenGUI is an annotated dataset containing a diverse collection of web UI screens generated using ChatGPT. Each interface is annotated with bounding boxes representing various UI components. A total of 13 main classes and 29 subclasses were identified, including elements such as text, buttons, icons, input fields, menus, containers, and images.

The GenGUI dataset consists of 250 annotated images of desktop web interfaces in multiple languages to reflect real-world UI diversity. It includes the following:
* 250 screenshots of web interfaces
* 20,484 annotated UI elements across 13 classes
* Variations in interface design, functionality, and language settings
  
This dataset is designed to support tasks such as UI element detection, interface recognition, and computer vision applications related to graphical user interfaces.
